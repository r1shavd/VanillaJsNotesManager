# Encrypted Notes Manager - VanillaJS

As per the name the tool named "Encrypted Notes Manager" is a notes management tool with the feature of encryption. One important thing about this project is that all the programming functionalities are made using plain client side javascript OR _VanillaJS_. Other scripting languages like HTML and CSS are used to create the web page elements, but all the major functionalities like creating notes, saving the notes, encryption and decryption are done using plain javascript, this makes this project a must do for all the freshers in JavaScript. Below are some points are about this project that you must go through.

* __Local Storage :-__ The tool saves all the notes to the local storage of the web browser after the completion of the encryption. So, no any external server is required during the process just the browser will keep all the records. But, note that in case you clear all the browser's cache, the saved data (existing notes) is also gone :-|.

* __Encryption :-__ The main feature of this notes manager tool that differentiate it from the other notes manager is the encryption feature. Our created tool has the feature to encrypt every notes that you create with different password. This feature implies that our private memories and data are secured from anyone else. The feature also implies that we can encrypt different notes as per the day or the reason the note is written. Like if I want to write a note about a person, then I would encrypt it with a password that is different from the other notes.

* __VanillaJS :-__ The word _VanillaJS_ has been appeared in the documentation over many times, and the real thing that it indicates is that the project is extremely easy and any fresher to JavaScript programming can do it ;-)

* __Single page tool :__ The tool is a single page HTML document linked with a javascript file and a stylesheet. So, there is less hardwork in maintenance of the source code files.

## About author

The tool is written by Rishav Das. I am a programmer and know python (django, general based, data science), javascript (nodeJs), PHP, C, C++. I have written this tool in intention to expertise the javascript language for the beginners. The tool does not need you to learn any server side programming or any sockets / nodes stuff. If you are new to javascript, here is your first project to start off ;-). I have made several beginner level javascript projects and all are available at my [github profile](https://github.com/rdofficial). One more thing about these projects are that the tutorials of making these projects including coding section, mathematical section are uploaded to [my youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfp-xR7cpyLOXVW8MYr59WA). If you haven't checked out my videos, check them out on my channel, you would get a better practical experience for the projects.

For the contributors, if you want to update any stuff on these projects, you can just create a pull request or just mail me at _rdofficial192@gmail.com_ with the updates. I'll check it out as soon as possible.
